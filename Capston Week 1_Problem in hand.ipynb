The project would pick neighborhoods and rank them according to their crimes. These neighborhoods would be further broken down into the types of crime which are most likely to happen helping police to choose their method for surgical action.\n\nThen the neighborhoods would be clustered to help police deploy patrolling vehicles. Each cluster would then be separately looked into to help State Police  segregate their area\n\nThis can also serve to be helpful for the new businessmen seeking to establish business in the region as to which cluster would be most preferred and which neighborhood in those particular clusters.</p>"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "<h1>Description of the data and how it will be used to solve the problem</h1>"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "Factors influencing our decisions are:\n    ranking neighborhoods based on the crimes\n    finding the most common crimes\n    choosing the right action for police deployment\n\nFollowing data sources will be needed to extract/generate the required information:\n\n- [ 1: Using a real world data set from Kaggle containing the Vancouver Crimes from 2003 to 2019](#part1):  A dataset consisting of the crime statistics of each Neighbourhoof in Vancouver along with type of crime, recorded year, month and hour.\n\n- [2: Gathering additional information of the list of officially categorized boroughs in Vancouver from Wikipedia.](#part2): Borough information will be used to map the existing data where each neighbourhood can be assigned with the right borough.\n\n- [3: Creating a new consolidated dataset of the Neighborhoods, along with their boroughs, crime data and the respective Neighbourhood's co-ordinates.](#part3): This data will be fetched using OpenCage Geocoder to find the safest borough and explore the neighbourhood by plotting it on maps using Folium and perform exploratory data analysis.\n\n- [4: Creating a new consolidated dataset of the Neighborhoods, boroughs, and the most common crimes and the respective Neighbourhood along with co-ordinates.](#part4): To explore the neighbourhood crimes and to apply machine learning algorithm to cluster the neighbourhoods and present the findings by plotting it on maps using Folium."}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "### 1: Using a real world data set from Kaggle containing the Vancouver Crimes from 2003 to 2019<a name=\"part1\"></a>\n\n\n####  Vancouver Crime Report \n\nProperties of the Crime Report\n\n*   TYPE - Crime type\n*   YEAR - Recorded year\n*   MONTH - Recorded month\n*   DAY - Recorded day\n*   HOUR - Recorded hour\n*   MINUTE - Recorded minute\n*   HUNDRED_BLOCK - Recorded block\n*   NEIGHBOURHOOD - Recorded neighborhood\n*   X - GPS longtitude\n*   Y - GPS latitude\n\nData set URL: https://www.kaggle.com/agilesifaka/vancouver-crime-report/version/"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "###  2: Gathering additional information about the Neighborhood from Wikipedia<a name=\"part2\"></a>\n\nAs part of data set Borough which the neighborhood was part of was not categorized, so we will create a dictionary of Neighborhood and based on data in the following [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_neighbourhoods_in_Vancouver)."}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "###  3: Creating a new consolidated dataset of the Neighborhoods, along with their boroughs, crime data and the respective Neighbourhood's co-ordinates.<a name=\"part3\"></a>: \n\nThis data will be fetched using OpenCage Geocoder to find the safest borough and explore the neighbourhood by plotting it on maps using Folium and perform exploratory data analysis."}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "### 4: Creating a new consolidated dataset of the Neighborhoods, boroughs, and the most common venues and the respective Neighbourhood along with co-ordinates.<a name=\"part4\"></a>: \nApply machine learning algorithm to cluster the neighbourhoods and present the findings by plotting it on maps using Folium"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "## Methodology<a name=\"methodology\"></a>\n\nCategorized the methodologysection into two parts:\n\n- <u>Exploratory Data Analysis</u>: Visualise the crime repots in different Vancouver boroughs to idenity the safest borough and normalise the neighborhoods of that borough.
